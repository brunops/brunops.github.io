<p>Animated solution for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">Tower of Hanoi</a> puzzle. The objective is to move all disks from one tower to another, according to the following constraints:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
  <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.</li>
  <li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
</ol>

<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>

<p id="controls" class="center">
  <label for="total-disks">Number of disks</label>
  <input type="text" id="total-disks" value="6">
  <button id="update-disks-btn" for="total-disks">Update</button>
</p>
<p id="error-msg" class="center"></p>

<p>The number of disks can be updated and the animation will be restarted.</p>
<p>Although the algorithm can eventually solve the puzzle for any given number, because it's complexity is O(2^n), for a given large number we wouldn't be alive to see the solution. So the maximum allowed number of disks is 10.</p>
