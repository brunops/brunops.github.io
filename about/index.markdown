My name is Bruno Sanches, I'm from Brazil. I am the kind of guy that learned C programming by himself while still in high school and that finds algorithms and computer science history interesting.

Graduated in Information Technology at [UNICAMP](http://www.unicamp.br) in 2010. Worked as a Software Engineer for 3 and a half years at CI&T doing Drupal, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL and Java. Left my job and came to San Francisco and graduated from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com) in October 2013.

This website is a way for me to post things that I enjoy, study and learn, aiming to keep track of them and to push myself into learning. I intend to cover any topics that interest me, so between tips, technology, reminders for myself, there may be some philosofical and divagation texts, and yes, lots of code.

Now I like to spend my time practicing TDD, JavaScript, Backbone, Node.js, learning more about UNIX philosophy, going to meetups and a lot more topics. I also tend to do a lot of stupid (and harmless) jokes after a lot of coffee :D
