Just got back from my vacation, backpacking through Europe, schedule was: Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Vienna, Budapest and Athens, great times! Unfortunately, due to some sickness, had to come back to Brazil 5 days earlier than expected. It was a great idea though, I'd probably be really bad now without medication, just missed Capadoccia, but I guess it will still be there for long after I'm gone, so, maybe next time :)

No excuses anymore, going back full time to my TODO list and all preparation work to Dev Bootcamp, just need some Ruby &gt;)
