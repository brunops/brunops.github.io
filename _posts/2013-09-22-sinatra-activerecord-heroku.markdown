Couldn't find an example with the bare bones of a Sinatra with ActiveRecord application that supports different databases<span> for each environment with as minimum code as possible. And how to successfully push it to Heroku. So I just created a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brunops/sinatra_activerecord_heroku">repo</a> with it.</span>

<span>Hope it helps. Any kind of feedback is appreciated.</span>
