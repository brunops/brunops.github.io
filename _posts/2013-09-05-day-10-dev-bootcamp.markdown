Solo Day! Pairing is awesome, but going solo sometimes is really cool too. Having support not to get stuck really motivates too.

There was a presentation/conversation session with the founder of DBC, Shereef, by the afternoon, in a way to get to know him better and to show transparency, really enjoyed it.

It's amazing how easy it is to parse HTML using Nokogiri. Only css selectors, beautiful.
