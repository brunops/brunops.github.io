<p>Solo Day! Pairing is awesome, but going solo sometimes is really cool too. Having support not to get stuck really motivates too.</p>
<p>There was a presentation/conversation session with the founder of DBC, Shereef, by the afternoon, in a way to get to know him better and to show transparency, really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><span>The challenges were related to scraping websites and retrieving information. An introduction to the power you&#8217;re about to receive, really manipulating the web and doing awesome stuff.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how easy it is to parse HTML using Nokogiri. Only css selectors, beautiful.</p>
