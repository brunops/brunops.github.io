Open a new Terminal window, from the Terminal (mac os), give focus to it and run some arbitrary code:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: true; first-line: 1">osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal"
  do script "echo wazzup"' -e 'activate' -e '
end tell'</pre>
So this will open a new Terminal and kindly say “wazzup”, but, of course, it’s possible execute whatever you want.. have you heard about cmatrix? cowsay? sl?

I feel that I shouldn’t be teaching this..
