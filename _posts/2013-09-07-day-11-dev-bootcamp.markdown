<p>Leaders are different from bosses. Leaders inspire and motivate people to achieve an objective. A boss is not capable of creating an identity between the people and the goal. Forcing his subordinates to exhale their motivation to conclude his own objectives. Leaders act in a way that there are no &#8220;subordinates&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bosses love to give their opinions about technical issues, usually unsubstantiated, simply opinions. Everybody has opinions (at least they should), people need something useful, bring data, what you &#8220;think&#8221; is usually a waste of time. The worst part is that it looks like a snowball, each boss works to fill their bosses spreadsheet with green items. Cascading through the hierarch until it hits someone who really knows how to do the job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impressive how motivated and interested you can be when you actually admire your leaders. When you care about what they say, because they usually know what they&#8217;re saying. And even more important, they are humble enough to recognize when they don&#8217;t. And there are a handful of people here which I&#8217;d consider as good leaders.</p>
<p>Okay, now I&#8217;m reeeeeally far away from a technical topic, so here is what I consider the <strong>best git intro ever</strong>, by Scott Chacon:</p>

<p>I lost track of how many times I already watched it.<span>Â Seriously, please let me know if you find a better one.</span></p>
