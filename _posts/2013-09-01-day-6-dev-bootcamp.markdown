<p>Saturday. Here at DBC, is like a less crowded week day, just a bit. Even though I stayed until midnight everyday, unsolved problems kept accumulating throughout the week. And guess what, there are weekend exercises as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an overwhelming number of challenges to solve, and it looks like as soon as you forget about your (stupid) pride, and simply understand what we&#8217;re really here for, the faster you&#8217;re going to focus on your self development.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not here to check solved problems boxes. We&#8217;re here to learn as much as we can. Maybe we can&#8217;t do all of the problems, and that&#8217;s fine, it must be fine. And I&#8217;m writing this right now to see if I can understand it myself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about stretching your boundaries, there are no golden stars. There&#8217;s you, and there&#8217;s a better you after going through the hardest path, are you willing to go that way?</p>
<p>Had a lot of challenges planned to do today. Got stuck most of the time on a recursive problem which as NOT planned for today, one that I thought it would take only an hour to solve. Kind of frustrating, but it&#8217;s good to know that I was actually practicing something I&#8217;m not good at. Solving the challenge in the end was just a bonus.</p>
