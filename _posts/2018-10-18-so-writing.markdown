So, writing

I guess I only need to start.

A couple rules here. It is paramount that no matter what I write has to be published. Don't worry about the quality, just always do your best at the moment. Nothing will ever be better than good enough, no matter how much you rewrite it anyway.

This in an attempt to get back at creating regularly. Practice. Quality doesn't matter at all, it's about quantity now. No one reads this anyway.

To honor the masters creatively is to compete with their attitude, not their results - that is, we must create, not revive

-- someone, somewhere

Done. That's what we're aiming for.
