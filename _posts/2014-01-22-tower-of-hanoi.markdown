excerpt: I always see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">Tower of Hanoi</a> problem exemple when reading about recursion, but I honestly had never implemented it, so I decided to understand it. I mean, should be easy.. after all, it's cited everywhere..<a href="/tower-of-hanoi"><img alt="Tower of Hanoi Animation" src="/assets/images/tower-of-hanoi.png"></a>

Well, it took longer than I expected for the algorithm to make sense to me, there are explanations everywhere, and <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/170/Syllabus/13/hanoi.html" target="_blank">this is the page</a> that really helped me to really understand the recursive algorithm.

After implementing it, it was still kind of blurry, so I had the great idea of creating a canvas animation with the step by step solution to really fix it in my head. I added the results into the projects page, and you can <a href="/projects/tower-of-hanoi">take a look at it here</a>.
