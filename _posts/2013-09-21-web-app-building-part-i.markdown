What will 5 hours, a rudimentary understanding of Sinatra/heroku/css/JavaScript/HTML, and two awesome co-developers in hacking-your-megabits and brunopsanches get you? A two page novelty app, that’s what.

Honestly, building this creaky, barely functional app was a top 3 moment for me at DBC. This thing is on the Internet, moving and talking to other pages, and yet we built with our bare hands. That’s so cool.

I was pretty amazed when I read an email from <a class="vt-p" href="http://raorao.tumblr.com/">raorao</a> saying our app was twitted by HN and was one of the top stories for a little bit. I am really glad my cohort is full of awesome people like him and <a class="vt-p" href="http://brunopsanches.tumblr.com/">Bruno</a>. Can’t wait to go to a Hachathon with these guys. 

So cool! hahaha
