<p>Karma is a really useful tool to speed up TDDing JavaScript. It is a node.js extension and it is really easy to set up.</p>
<p>Assuming you have npm installed, the steps are:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Install Karma</p>
<p><code>npm install -g karma</code></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Go to your project folder and init Karma</p>
<p><code>cd ~/my_l33t_project</code></p>
<p><code>karma init</code></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Follow the instructions, choose your test suite, like Jasmine, and that will create a karma.conf.js file with its configurations.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If everything goes well, you&#8217;ll be able to start it with:</p>
<p><code>karma start</code></p>
<p>Detailed information can be found on <a class="vt-p" href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma">Karma github page</a> or the <a class="vt-p" href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">official page</a>.</p>
<p>When starting, it will trigger a chrome window where the tests will be run on the background, the only thing you have to see is the console. Personally I use sizeUp to change the size of the windows so it&#8217;s possible to see the editor and the terminal at the same time. This way, there&#8217;s no need to keep switching between windows and refreshing the browser all the time.</p>

<p>Karma will watch your files for modifications and run the tests on every file save, and because it&#8217;s not running the whole browser, it&#8217;ll take a ridiculously small amount of time to run all the tests. Instant feedback on every <code>Cmd + S</code>. Awesome.</p>
