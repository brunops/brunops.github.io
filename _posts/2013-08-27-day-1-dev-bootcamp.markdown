title: Day 1 - Dev Bootcamp

Today was my first day at DBC, I am just amazed with the environment. They managed to put everybody in touch, from all phases, really emphasizing how important it is to know each other, like a really big family. Everybody seems to put a lot of effort in the program and to be very helpful all the time, which are some of the most important things in my opinion, really motivating.

There was a long round of introduction before lunch, and after that, lots of problem solving with pair programming, which is really good to exchange experiences and get to know other people strenghts and limits, as well as your own. Good fun.

Left there at midnight, still couldn't finish the Battleship challenge, kind of frustrating, but frustration is something that we all have to deal with. I was planning to write something more detailed but getting a nice sleep is a important thing as well.

Keep pushing!
