Hello, I'm <strong>Bruno Sanches</strong>, from Brazil. I'm the kind of guy who learned to program by himself while still in high school for fun.

Currently working with website development with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, using Drupal CMS. Really love <strong>JavaScript</strong>, jQuery and all awesome front-end effects to improve UX and to have fun.

I've created this blog for myself to post things that I enjoy, study and learn, aiming to keep track of them and to push myself into learning. I intend to cover any topics that interest me, so between tips, technology, reminders for myself, there may be some bar philosofical texts and divagations, and yes, there will be lots of code.

I've decided to write in english to keep improving myself but still have the intention to translate everything into portugues and provide the contents in both languages.

My current interests include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Personal Development</li>
	<li>SEO</li>
	<li>Artificial Inteligence</li>
	<li>Philosophy</li>
	<li>Ruby (Rails)</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>Linux</li>
	<li>Drupal</li>
	<li>Front-end development</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>RegEx</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>CSS3</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
Don't know if it is a good idea to keep these topics because this list keeps changing and increasing on a daily basis, but maybe it's good to get the bigger picture of what should be covered around here..

Hope you'll enjoy :)
